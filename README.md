Password Complexity Checker

Build a tool that assesses the strength of a password based on criteria such as length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Provide feedback to users on the password's strength.

This is a simple implementation of a Password Complexity Checker in Python. This tool evaluates the strength of a password based on the specified criteria: length, presence of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

# How to Use the Tool
Copy and paste the code into a Python environment (like Jupyter Notebook, or any Python IDE).
Run the script. It will prompt you to enter a password.
After you input a password, it will assess its strength and provide feedback based on the criteria defined.

# Criteria for Password Strength
Length: At least 8 characters.
Uppercase Letters: At least one uppercase letter (A-Z).
Lowercase Letters: At least one lowercase letter (a-z).
Numbers: At least one digit (0-9).
Special Characters: At least one special character (e.g., @$!%*?&).

# Password Strength Levels
Very Strong: Meets all criteria.
Strong: Meets 4 out of 5 criteria.
Moderate: Meets 3 out of 5 criteria.
Weak: Meets 2 out of 5 criteria.
Very Weak: Meets 1 or none of the criteria.
